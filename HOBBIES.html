  <h1>HOBBIES</h1>
  <h3>TRAVELLING A LOT</h3>
  <p>There are numerous benefits of travelling if we think about it.The first one being, we meet new people. When we meet new people, we get the opportunity to make new friends. It may be a fellow traveller or the local, we ask for directions.

    Moreover, new age technology has made it easier to keep in touch with them. Thus, it offers not only a great way to understand human nature but also explore new places with those friends to make our trip easy.
    
    We will learn how other people eat, speak, live and more. When we get out of our comfort zone, we will become more sensitive towards other cultures and the people.
    
    Another important factor which we learn when we travel is learning new skills. When we go to hilly areas, we will most likely trek and thus trekking will be a new skill added to our list.
    
    Similarly, scuba diving or more can also be learned while travelling. A very important thing which travelling teaches us is to enjoy nature. It helps us appreciate the true beauty of the earth.</p>
